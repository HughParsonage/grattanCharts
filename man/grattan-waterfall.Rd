\arguments{
\item{.data}{a data frame containing two columns, one with the values, the other with the labels}

\item{values}{a numeric vector making up the heights of the rectangles in the waterfall}

\item{labels}{the labels corresponding to each vector, marked on the x-axis}

\item{rect_text_labels}{(character) a character vector of the same length as values that are placed on the rectangles}

\item{rect_text_size}{size of the text in the rectangles}

\item{rect_text_labels_anchor}{(character) How should rect_text_labels be positioned. In future releases, we might have support for north or south anchors, or for directed positioning (negative down, positive up) etc. For now, only centre is supported.}

\item{put_rect_text_outside_when_value_below}{(numeric) the text labels accompanying a rectangle of this height will be placed outside the box: below if it's negative; above if it's positive.}

\item{calc_total}{(logical) should the final pool of the waterfall be calculated (and placed on the chart)}

\item{total_axis_text}{(character) the text appearing on the axis underneath the total rectangle}

\item{total_rect_text}{(character) the text in the middle of the rectangle of the total rectangle}

\item{total_rect_color}{the color of the final rectangle}

\item{total_rect_text_color}{the color of the final rectangle's label text}

\item{fill_colours}{Colours to be used to fill the rectangles, in order. Disregarded if \code{fill_by_sign} is \code{TRUE} (the default).}

\item{fill_by_sign}{(logical) should positive and negative values each have the same colour?}

\item{dark}{(logical) (only for fill_by_sign) should the dark palette be used?}

\item{rect_width}{(numeric) the width of the rectangle, relative to the space between each label factor}

\item{rect_border}{the border around each rectangle. Choose NA if no border is desired.}

\item{draw_lines}{(logical) should lines be drawn between successive rectangles}

\item{lines_anchors}{a character vector of length two specifying the horizontal placement (\code{left}, \code{centre}, \code{right}) of the drawn lines relative to the preceding and successive rectangles, respectively.}

\item{linetype}{the linetype for the draw_lines}

\item{draw_axis.x}{(character) one of "none", "behind", "front" whether to draw an x.axis line and whether to draw it behind or in front of the rectangles, default is behind}

\item{x_axis_labels}{Whether or not to draw x-axis labels.}

\item{theme_text_family}{(character) Passed to the \code{text} argument in \code{ggplot2::theme}.}

\item{print_plot}{(logical) Whether or not the plot should be printed. By default, \code{TRUE}, which means it cannot be assigned.}

\item{ggplot_object_name}{(character) A quoted valid object name to which ggplot layers may be addded after the function has run. Ignored if \code{print} is \code{FALSE}.}
